#Original code by Georgejsp, edited by RCV
#This script will alter the ratio file output from Control FREEC. This will add a column with sample name and a column with the output ploidy
#These changes are useful for plotting CNVs in R, and this can be skipped if you figure out a better way to plot many graphs at once
#This script is called by the modifyFREECRatio.sh script and must be in the same directory as it.
#
#You can also run this script by itself on one sample via:
# ./modifyRatio.sh info.txt ratio.txt
